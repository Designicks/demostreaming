### What i think...

<p>1> I decided on the technical and architectural choices used as part of
this project solution as </p>
 <h6> This project is created useing multiple components in a single system to optimize each section of code with the best architecture. Since it is Dynamic Data flow app, in which the content need to provide in a smoother and faster way to users as they won't be waiting for page/content to load, and then go through and access it.
 React Provides a simplified way to render the only useful/ wanted content as per the user need with the help of React Feactures like "Lazy Loading", "Splitting code into components", "Virtual DOM" - Navigation without Loading whole page instead particular Content/DOM, "State Management", "Props Handling", and "React Bootstrapping" and so on. </h6>

<h6>This app is Splitted into following Components:
<ul>
    <li>Header Component</li>
    <li>Main Content Component</li>
    <li>Movies Component</li>
    <li>Series Component</li>
    <li>Movie/Serie Card Component</li>
    <li>Not Found Component</li>
    <li>Footer Component</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Data is Fetched from JSON API.</li>
    <li>Fetched Data is Filtered in Ascending Alphabetical Order according to Project Requirements.</li>
    <li>Sorted Data is Filtered according to Project Requirements.</li>
    <li>This Data is well presented using the minified UI Design generated in JSX format.</li>

</ul>

<h6>In this Movies/Series Steaming App, As per User Experience all these factor matters a lot. So This app is technically and architecturally created for the same.</h6>
<h6>Code is Well Tested, Reuseable and Maintainable.</h6>


<p>2> Yes I could make some improvements to this submission as</p>
<h6>As a User Interface and User Experience Developer I can think more better for this App, Since the given doc file has only limited information about this project. But I can make a it more better</h6>

 <p>If I were allocated more time I would do it differently in a way that:</p>
 <h6>UI is the very first Factor that can make a Product Succed. Bcoz it is only a way for USERS to Interact with the Product/Project. So UI can be more Rich & Enhanced.</h6>

<h6>A better Web App Flow can be plan. So that User won't get confuse anywhere during navigating project.</h6>
